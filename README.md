## Bone Condition Prediction

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict potential bone conditions based on medical scans and related patient data. The aim is to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of bone-related issues.

### Project Motivation

Bone conditions such as osteoporosis and fractures can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Early diagnosis can help in taking preventive actions. This project leverages traditional machine learning methods to predict potential bone conditions, offering a data-driven approach to support clinical decisions.

### Installation and Requirements

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

#### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository and access the notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### Usage

Once the repository is cloned, you can explore and run the notebook by starting Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook Bone_prediction.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and generate predictions.

### Dataset

- **Source**: [Mention the data source if available, or note if it's proprietary.]
- **Size**: [Number of rows and columns.]
- **Features**: 
  - Medical scan data

The dataset includes features related to bone health, and is processed to handle missing values, normalize the data, and encode categorical variables.

### Modeling Approach

The machine learning approach taken in this project focuses on traditional models.

#### Data Preprocessing

- **Missing Data**: Missing values were handled using techniques such as median imputation.
- **Scaling**: Continuous variables were standardized to ensure the models perform well.
- **Train-Test Split**: The data was split into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

#### Model Architecture

The following traditional machine learning models were used in this project:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model was trained using a cross-validation approach to ensure robust evaluation.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Correctness of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Sensitivity of the model to detect true positives.
- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of the modelâ€™s performance.

### Results

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of [X%] on the test set.
- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix below shows the performance of the model in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Example visualizations include:

- Accuracy score plot
- Confusion matrix
- Feature importance (for Random Forest)

### Future Improvements

This project could be improved in several ways:

- **Feature Engineering**: More features from the dataset or external sources could improve model performance.
- **Model Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search could further enhance accuracy.
- **Additional Algorithms**: Testing more machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) could offer further improvements.
